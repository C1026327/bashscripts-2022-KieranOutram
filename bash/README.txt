Google Mail does not want to recieve any form of email as well as the Email commands not seeming to work overall.
I have attempted four different things.
The Mail Command (MailUtils)
Setting up SMTP to work with the Mail Command using my own student email.
Using 'Mutt' to send a mail.
Using "SendMail" (Final result)
Sendmail uses my own personal email linked to Yahoo's SMTP server.
Please do not share my personal yahoo mail.

It does not seem to go further than this due to it being blocked by Gmail as a whole or Student Emails
I have researched why this may be, it seems to be due to new policies or policies as a general.
